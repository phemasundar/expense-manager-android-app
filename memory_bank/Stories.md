## Epic 1: User Authentication & Profile Management

### Story 1.1: User Registration & Login via Clerk  
**Tasks:**  
- Integrate Clerk SDK on Android  
- Implement backend Clerk JWT validation middleware  
- Create `/users/me` endpoint to fetch user profile data  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Users must be able to register and login using Clerk on the Android app.  
- Backend validates JWT on all secured endpoints.  
- `/users/me` returns the authenticated user's profile info accurately.  
- Unauthorized requests return 401 errors.

## Epic 2: Receipt Upload & OCR Processing

### Story 2.1: Receipt Image Upload API  
**Tasks:**  
- Create `/receipts/upload` POST endpoint accepting image files  
- Validate file type, size, and user authentication  
- Store uploaded image temporarily  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- API accepts only valid image formats (JPEG, PNG).  
- Files exceeding size limits (e.g., >5MB) are rejected with 400 error.  
- Unauthorized requests result in 401 errors.  
- Uploaded image is successfully stored temporarily for processing.

### Story 2.2: OCR Integration with Google Cloud Vision API  
**Tasks:**  
- Implement asynchronous call to Google Cloud Vision API  
- Parse and extract text and line items from OCR response  
- Handle OCR errors and retries  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- OCR requests are sent automatically after image upload.  
- Text extraction yields receipt lines and totals with >85% accuracy.  
- OCR failure triggers retry or user-friendly error message.  

### Story 2.3: Save OCR Results as Receipts and Items in DB  
**Tasks:**  
- Design data model mappings for receipt and items  
- Persist extracted data in tables: receipts, receipt_items, items  
- Link receipt to user and store  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Receipt records contain correct metadata (date, total, store).  
- All extracted items are saved with names, quantities, and prices.  
- Receipt is linked to authenticated user and assigned to store where applicable.

## Epic 3: Expense Viewing & Management

### Story 3.1: List User Receipts  
**Tasks:**  
- Create `/receipts` GET endpoint returning user receipts list  
- Implement pagination and filter by date range  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Only receipts belonging to authenticated user are returned.  
- Pagination supports page size and page number parameters.  
- Filter by date range returns correct subset.

### Story 3.2: View Individual Receipt Details  
**Tasks:**  
- Create `/receipts/{id}` GET endpoint  
- Fetch receipt with all linked items and store info  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Endpoint returns full receipt data with items and store details.  
- Accessing receipts not owned by user returns 403 Forbidden.

## Epic 4: Frontend User Interface & Integration

### Story 4.1: Receipt Upload UI  
**Tasks:**  
- Implement camera and gallery image picker  
- Integrate upload functionality to backend `/receipts/upload`  
- Show upload progress and success/failure notifications  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- User can pick or take receipt photo.  
- Upload progress is visible to user.  
- On success, user sees confirmation and receipt preview.  
- On failure, readable error message is displayed.

### Story 4.2: Display Receipts and Expense Breakdown  
**Tasks:**  
- Show list of receipts grouped by date  
- Display receipt detail view with items and totals  
- Bind UI components to API response data  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Receipt lists load within 3 seconds.  
- Receipt details are accurate and formatted cleanly.  
- UI updates reflect any new receipts uploaded.

## Epic 5: Deployment & CI/CD Automation

### Story 5.1: Docker Environment Setup  
**Tasks:**  
- Create Dockerfile for backend with multi-stage build  
- Setup PostgreSQL container configuration  
- Define Docker Compose for local development  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Backend builds successfully into Docker images.  
- Containers can be run together locally with network connectivity.  

### Story 5.2: GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline  
**Tasks:**  
- Automate Gradle build, linting, and test stages  
- Build and push Docker images to container registry on push to main branch  
- Deploy images to staging and then to production on manual approval  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Push triggers pipeline execution successfully.  
- Tests run and pass on every pipeline execution.  
- Deployment to staging occurs automatically after tests pass.  
- Production deployment only occurs after manual approval.

## Epic 6: Testing & Quality Assurance

### Story 6.1: Backend Unit and Integration Tests  
**Tasks:**  
- Write unit tests for core service methods and utilities  
- Create integration tests covering controller-service-repository workflows  
- Mock Clerk authentication and Google Cloud Vision API in tests  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
